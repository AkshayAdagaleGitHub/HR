Completing Questions of HackerRank
Code from Day 8 : Working with Dictionary and Maps

Question : 
Given names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers. You will then be given an
unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each name queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line
in the form name=phoneNumber; if an entry for name is not found, print Not found instead. 

Note: Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/HashMap data structure.
